1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

MySQL can provide responses to requests made over the network.  The client
makes a request to the server, quite often between 2 physical machines over
the network. The server provides the response.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

Using "help SELECT" from the monitor prompt provides information about the
syntax of the SELECT statement and details about using it.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

In interactive mode the user issues single commands/queries at the monitor prompt and
receives responses. In bath mode multiple commands and/or queries can be
stored in a file and then MySQL will process the entire set of commands in
the file in sequential order.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

The user option allows you to specify which MySQL username to use when
accessing the MySQL server.

The password option allows you to submit your password so that your
credentials can be verified for the particualar username being accessed.

The database option allows you to specify which database you will use, this
way you do not have to use the "use" command at the monitor prompt.
